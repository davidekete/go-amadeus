# HTTP Requests in Go

This project demonstrates how to make HTTP requests in Go, including `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` requests, while handling authentication using OAuth2. It interacts with the Amadeus API to fetch flight destinations, cancel orders, and delete flight orders.

## Project Structure

```
http-requests/
├── client.go         # Contains HTTP client logic for GET, POST, and DELETE requests
├── models.go         # Defines data models for API responses
├── main.go           # Entry point of the application
├── .env.example      # Example environment file for API credentials
├── .gitignore        # Ignores sensitive files like .env
├── go.mod            # Go module file with dependencies
```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- An Amadeus API account with valid `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`
- .env file with the following variables:
  ```
  API_KEY=<your_api_key>
  API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davidekete/go-amadeus.git
   cd http-requests
   ```

2. Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in your API credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. The program will fetch flight destinations from the Amadeus API and print the response in a formatted JSON structure.

## Code Overview

### main.go

The entry point of the application:
- Loads environment variables using `godotenv`.
- Calls the `GetRequest` function to fetch flight destinations.
- Prints the response in a human-readable JSON format.

### client.go

Contains the core HTTP client logic:
- **`getAccessToken`**: Fetches an OAuth2 access token.
- **`GetRequest`**: Sends a `GET` request to retrieve flight destinations.
- **`PostRequest`**: Sends a `POST` request to cancel a transfer order.
- **`DeleteRequest`**: Sends a `DELETE` request to delete a flight order.

### models.go

Defines the data models for API responses:
- `AccessTokenResponse`: Represents the OAuth2 token response.
- `FlightResponse`: Represents the response for flight destinations.
- `CancellationResponse`: Represents the response for order cancellations.

### .env.example

Provides a template for environment variables:
- `API_KEY`: Your Amadeus API key.
- `API_SECRET`: Your Amadeus API secret.

### .gitignore

Ensures sensitive files like .env are not committed to version control.

## Example Output

When running the application, you should see a JSON response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "flight-destination",
      "origin": "PAR",
      "destination": "NYC",
      "departureDate": "2025-06-01",
      "returnDate": "2025-06-15",
      "price": {
        "total": "300.00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

- If the .env file is missing or invalid, the program will terminate with an error.
- Non-2xx HTTP responses are handled gracefully with descriptive error messages.

## Dependencies

- [joho/godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv): Loads environment variables from a .env file.
